I want you to perform an airflow project on flight price analysis based on the instruction from task.md. I have also included the dataset in this folder. Use the Medallion arhitecture to store the data in the appropriate tables. Bronze in the postgresql database should contain the raw data from the csv file. Make sure to perform validation before loading the data into the bronze table. the column names are not named properly, so make sure to rename them before loading the data into the bronze table and all the validation check in the task.md for the staging table should be performed. In the silver table, perform the data validation by checking all required columns exist, handle missing or null values, duplicate etc. Rows that fail should be logged. The Gold table should contain the computed KPIs and metrics. use the dbt, data modelling (dimension and fact tables) and astronomer to run the airflow project.
